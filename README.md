# Prestidigitation_BG3
Mod to add Prestidigitation to BG3 for surface cleaning


Adds a limited version of the prestidigitation cantrip to BG3. The cantrip seems to be well suited to surface effect management and dying to surface effects out of combat is annoying. In line with the cantrips abilities in 5e, you can snuff or light fires and clean soiled surfaces. No damage is dealt only surface effects are altered. 

The mod is not in a final version, just putting up in-case others might want the cantrip before Larian adds it. I haven't tested it extensively so feel free to test if you wish.
